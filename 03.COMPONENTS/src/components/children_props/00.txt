In React, the term children refers to the elements passed between a component's opening and closing tags. 
It's a special prop that automatically gets the value of whatever is put inside a component's JSX. 
Think of it like a container that a parent component can fill with content for its child component. ðŸ“¦



How Children Props Work
A component that uses children is designed to be a generic wrapper.
 It doesn't need to know in advance what content it will contain.
  This is a powerful concept for creating reusable UI components like a Card, Modal, or Layout component.
   The parent component provides the content, and the child component provides the structure or styling around that content.

The children prop is accessed just like any other prop, usually through destructuring in the component's function signature.
